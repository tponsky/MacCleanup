# MacCleanup - New Features ✨

## Enhanced Features Added

### 1. **Better File Descriptions** 📝
Files now show descriptive titles instead of just filenames:
- **Screenshots**: "Screenshot from 2026-01-12 at 6.23.06 PM"
- **Presentations**: "Presentation Deck: GCMD Marketing" or "Pitch Presentation: October 2021"
- **Videos**: "Demo Video: ChatGPT Demo" or "Screen Recording: 2026-01-10"
- **PDFs**: "Report: Innovation Brief" or "Brief: Organoid Opportunity"
- **Documents**: "Script/Notes: Telementoring" or "Resume/CV: Todd Ponsky"

### 2. **Version Detection** 🏷️
The app now identifies which files are the latest version:
- **Green "LATEST" badge** on the most recent version
- **Yellow "DUPLICATE" badge** on older versions
- Shows date comparison: "Duplicate: 1/10/2026, Original: 1/5/2026"
- Automatically keeps the latest version when cleaning duplicates

### 3. **Selectable Actions** ☑️
You now have full control:
- **Checkboxes** next to each action
- **Select All** / **Deselect All** buttons
- Only selected actions are executed
- Counter shows "X of Y selected"

### 4. **Clarifying Questions** ❓
The app asks for your input when needed:
- Large videos when SSD isn't connected: "Move to Dropbox or keep on laptop?"
- Recent installers: "Delete or keep?"
- Ambiguous file types get flagged for review

### 5. **Enhanced Preview** 👀
The preview now shows:
- File descriptions (not just names)
- File sizes and age
- Destination paths
- Version indicators
- Grouped duplicates with original file info

## How to Use

1. **Click "Preview Cleanup"** to see all suggested actions
2. **Review each item** - check the description and version badges
3. **Select/deselect** actions using checkboxes
4. **Use "Select All"** if you trust all suggestions
5. **Click "Run Cleanup"** to execute only selected actions

## Example Workflow

```
1. Preview shows: "Presentation Deck: GCMD Marketing (1).pptx [DUPLICATE]"
   Original: "Presentation Deck: GCMD Marketing.pptx [LATEST]"
   
2. You see: Latest version is checked, duplicate is unchecked
   
3. You can: 
   - Keep both (uncheck delete on duplicate)
   - Delete duplicate (leave checked)
   - Review dates to confirm which is actually newer
```

## Visual Indicators

- 🟢 **Green border** = Latest version (keep this one)
- 🟡 **Yellow badge** = Duplicate (usually safe to delete)
- 🔴 **Red badge** = Will be deleted
- ✅ **Checkbox checked** = Action will be executed
- ⬜ **Checkbox unchecked** = Action will be skipped
