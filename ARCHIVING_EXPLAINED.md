# What Happens When Files Are Archived

## Archiving Explained

When a file is marked for "archive", it's **moved** (not copied, not deleted) to an Archive folder in your Dropbox.

### Where Files Go:

1. **Old Screenshots (>30 days old)**
   - From: `~/Desktop/` or `~/Downloads/`
   - To: `~/Dropbox/Media/Screenshots/Archive/`
   - Purpose: Keeps your Desktop clean, but preserves old screenshots

2. **Old Files (>90 days old)**
   - From: `~/Desktop/`, `~/Downloads/`, or `~/Documents/`
   - To: `~/Dropbox/Archive/`
   - Purpose: Moves old files off your laptop but keeps them in Dropbox

### Important Notes:

- ✅ Files are **moved**, not deleted - they're still accessible in Dropbox
- ✅ Files keep their original names and content
- ✅ You can still search for them in Dropbox
- ✅ They sync to the cloud, so they don't take up laptop space
- ✅ You can access them from any device with Dropbox

### How to Access Archived Files:

1. Open Dropbox folder on your Mac
2. Navigate to `Media/Screenshots/Archive/` for old screenshots
3. Navigate to `Archive/` for other old files
4. Files are organized by date (oldest at bottom)

### To Restore a File:

Simply drag it back from the Archive folder to wherever you want it.

**Bottom line:** Archiving moves files to Dropbox Archive folders to free up laptop space while keeping everything accessible.
